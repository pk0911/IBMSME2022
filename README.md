## DAY 2 10th November 2022 Workflow

A Workflow is defined as a sequence of tasks that processes data through a specific path from initiation to completion.

I learnt and worked on Alteryx powered by Trifacta Alteryx : Self-Service Analytics, Data Science & Automation tool which is designed for analysts to explore, transform, and enrich raw data into clean and structured formats.

I analyzed the dataset of Sales Analysis of Boats having 10 columns and 9889 rows . The dataset consisted a sample size of 10 columns and 9889 rows of data about boats from different countries across the globe.

The first step of my analysis was to review data and search for any missing values and remove them inorder to get the most suitable and accurate outcome. Then by performing some basic calculations, I calculated the popularity and size of the boats.
